# Portfolio Webpage HW >

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio webpage that had an intractive navbar that takes you to assigned sections. There is supposed to be an image of a recent photo or avatar. The portfolio section is supposed to have images and the first one is supposed to be the largest. The images are supposed to be clickable and take you to the deployed application. There should be a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.

## Steps Taken
